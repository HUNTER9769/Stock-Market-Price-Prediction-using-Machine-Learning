This project aims to predict stock market prices using machine learning techniques. </br>
Built with Dash, a productive Python framework for creating web applications, and Plotly, a graphing library for interactive and publication-quality visualizations, the application allows users to visualize historical stock data and future predictions. </br>
The project structure includes key components such as the main application script (app.py), historical stock data currently using yahoo finance API. </br>
And various dropdwon selectable Machine Learning Models including LSTM, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest Classifier.  </br>
Custom CSS and other assets enhance the user interface. To get started, clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the application locally to explore and predict stock market prices interactively.</br>
